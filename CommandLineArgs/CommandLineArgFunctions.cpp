//argv is a pointer to an array in main
//argc is an int in main

//const int * argv[]
//point to the array argv in which its type is contstant, aka array of ints that can't change

//What is the first element of the argv array (argv[0])?


//make sure the values of ints in argv[0] are constant
// why
//we are only writing a function to point at the first element
//if the ints in argv[0] weren't constant, what are some potential errors that could arise?
